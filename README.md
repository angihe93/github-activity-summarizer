## üéØ What is GitHub Activity Summarizer?

GitHub Activity Summarizer is a tool that helps you gain instant insights into what a company has been building. Just input the URL of a GitHub organization, and the tool live crawls the company's GitHub and summarizes the recently updated repos and commits for you, helping you cut through the noise and see the real progress in engineering -- so you can stay ahead of what matters most.

Example result for github.com/openai:

## üìä Data Sources & API Endpoints
All data is fetched using Exa's powerful crawler. You can read more about the crawler API [here](https://docs.exa.ai/reference/get-contents), the TypeScript SDK [here](https://docs.exa.ai/sdks/typescript-sdk-specification#getcontents-method), and try it in the [playground](https://dashboard.exa.ai/playground/get-contents).

It is possible to also get this data from the GitHub API and process it with LLM, but I wanted to explore Exa's live crawlers for this project. I am pretty impressed with the performance and ease of use!
